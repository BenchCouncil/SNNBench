# SNNBench: An End-to-End AI-Oriented Spiking Neural Network Benchmark

SNNBench is the first end-to-end AI-oriented Spiking Neural Network (SNN) benchmark that covers the processing stages of training and inference, and includes accuracy information. Focusing on two typical AI applications, image classification and speech recognition, SNNBench provides nine workloads that consider the unique characteristics of both SNNs and AI.

## Features

- Covers the processing stages of training and inference
